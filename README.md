# PhasicFlow-coupling
Fluid-particle coupling is a software package for simulating fluid-particle flows. The fluid is assumed as a continuum phase and the particles as discrete bodies. Fluid is modeled using CFD and particles using DEM. The calculations in the DEM part are done using [PhasicFlow](https://github.com/PhasicFlow/phasicFlow) and the calculations in the CFD part are done using OpenFOAM.
